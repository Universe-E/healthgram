### Conflict Resolution Protocol

- if a member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines, we will decrease his contribution, generally this not happens in our team
- if your group has issues, we will have on-site meeting, to solve issues as soon as possible
- if a member gets sick, we will assign tasks to him and continue to proceed, generally this not happens in our team
- If we have merge conflict, we will send direct message to each other, or have on-site meeting, to solve conflicts as soon as possible
